# HDDFailure

We need to predict if a hard drive is going to fail in the next 'N' days('N' is optimal value).<br />
If we can predict failure before 'N' days, we get sufficient time to retrieve the data and can replace that with a new drive.<br />
Using the data provided by Backblaze, we apply different machine learning algorithms to predict the failures.
